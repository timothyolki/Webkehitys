    <p>
        Project website conducted by Markus, Timo and Petteri for a school assignment.<br>
        Website utilizes five different code languages; JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, CSS aswell as HTML.<br>
        Our idea was to create a website where users could stay up-to-date with their favourite eSports games and events.<br>
        Most of our goals were accomplished, however due to our lack of experience in the code languages mentioned above, <br>
        some of the functionalities we originally planned to include were left out.
